This App is Created during Err 404 Saboo Siddique 24 Hr Hackathon. 

Our Problem Statement was to Create an android app to connect the sources of waste food production and channelling the edible food collected by the volunteers of NGOs and dispersion between the deprived people 


# Solution
***

Our App focuses on collection of food from the hotels and caterers which contains of large amount of edible cooked/uncooked food . The app will contain features for the hotel management to input the amount of food leftovers and approximate conditions in which they are at the time of logging .


On receiving above information, the volunteers of NGOs will carry out  major functionalities
Checking the condition of Food on Collection from hotels
This will be carried or manually by the volunteers. They will ensure the edibility of the collected food and the time period for which the food will be edible by the people. 
This includes looking for the needy and identifying Hotspots .This will be Marked by the volunteers on the Map and will be informed to the volunteers bringing food This also includes collection of data of the deprived They will also find the required amount of food required by the people


Transportation of Food from Hotels to Hotspots


This includes transportation of the food to Hotspots in edible form. The location of the transports will be updated in the app along the quantity left in the convoy. Real Time updates on the transports will help in reducing time for distribution and loss of food due to decomposition.


This system uses Google Maps APIs and FireBases Cloud Solutions for Backend Functionality of the App .In the Database side it requires list of NGOs and volutneers that help in collection and distribution of food and List of Hotels that support this initiative and following the standards .
